# MD047 - single-trailing-newline

Files should end with a single newline character.

**Tags:** blank_lines

**Aliases:** single-trailing-newline

**Fixable:** ✓ Yes (auto-fix available)

## Rationale

POSIX defines a line as ending with a newline character. Many tools expect files to end with a newline, and version control systems may show spurious diffs if the final newline is missing.

## Examples

### ❌ Incorrect

```markdown
# Heading

Content here[EOF - no newline]
```

The file ends without a trailing newline character.

### ✓ Correct

```markdown
# Heading

Content here
[newline][EOF]
```

The file ends with exactly one newline character.

## Configuration

No configuration options for this rule.

## Auto-fix Behavior

When `--fix` is used, MD047 will:
- Add a trailing newline if missing
- Remove extra trailing newlines (leaving exactly one)

The fix preserves the document's line ending style (LF or CRLF).
