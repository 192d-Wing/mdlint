# MD001 - heading-increment

Heading levels should only increment by one level at a time.

**Tags:** headings

**Aliases:** heading-increment, header-increment

**Fixable:** ✓ Yes (auto-fix available)

## Rationale

Markdown headings create a document outline. Skipping heading levels (e.g., going from H1 directly to H3) can confuse readers and break document structure in tools that generate tables of contents.

## Examples

### ❌ Incorrect

```markdown
# Heading 1

### Heading 3

We skipped heading 2!
```

This violates MD001 because the H3 follows an H1 without an H2 in between.

### ✓ Correct

```markdown
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

Proper heading hierarchy.
```

## Configuration

No configuration options for this rule.

However, if front matter is present with a `title` field, MD001 treats it as an implicit H1:

```markdown
---
title: Document Title
---

## Section 1

This is valid - the front matter title acts as H1.
```

## Auto-fix Behavior

When `--fix` is used, MD001 cannot directly fix heading level issues (it would require knowing the intended structure). This rule is marked as fixable but does not emit `fix_info`.
